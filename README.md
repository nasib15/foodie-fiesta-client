# Foodie Fiesta

#### Foodie Fiesta is a Food Sharing and Surplus Reduction Platform where a user can add/request for food.

## Features of this Website

- Logged-in users can add food items to the website, similar to creating a restaurant menu. They can specify relevant
  information. However, a user cannot request their own food listings to maintain fairness and prevent self-promotion.
- Users can browse through the list of available food items added by other users and request items they are interested in
  trying. Once a request is made, it's recorded in a table for easy reference. Also, a user can pay for the listed food
- Used JWT to ensure the backend to be secured
